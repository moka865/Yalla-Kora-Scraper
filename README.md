# Yalla-Kora-Scraper
Yalla Kora Match Scraper is a Python-based tool that fetches football match details from the Yalla Kora website for a specified date or date range. The program extracts key information, including team names, match time, tournament name, and match results (if available). The retrieved data is then stored in a structured CSV file for further analysis or reference.
